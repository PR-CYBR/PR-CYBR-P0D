# Implementation Notes

## Summary
This repository has been set up as an automated podcast episode management system that syncs with a Notion database called "pr-cyberpod".

## What's Ready
- ✅ Complete repository structure from spec-bootstrap
- ✅ Python sync script with Notion API integration
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflows (sync + branch creation)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Security validated (no vulnerabilities)

## User Configuration Required
Before the system can sync episodes:

1. Create Notion Database
   - Name: "pr-cyberpod"
   - Required properties: Title, Episode Live, Release Date, File URL

2. Generate Notion Integration
   - Visit: https://www.notion.so/my-integrations
   - Create integration with read access
   - Connect to pr-cyberpod database

3. Configure GitHub Secrets
   - NOTION_TOKEN
   - NOTION_DATABASE_ID

4. Run Workflows
   - "Create Branch Structure" (one-time)
   - "Sync Notion Episodes" (to test)

## Documentation
- README.md - Main documentation
- SETUP.md - Complete setup guide
- QUICKSTART.md - Quick reference
- CONTRIBUTING.md - Development workflow
- episodes/README.md - Episodes directory guide

## Files Overview
- scripts/sync_notion.py - Main sync script
- .github/workflows/sync-notion-episodes.yml - Daily sync workflow
- .github/workflows/create-branches.yml - Branch setup workflow
- .specify/ - Spec-Kit framework files
- episodes/ - Podcast episode storage

## Branch Structure
The "Create Branch Structure" workflow will create:
- dev, spec, plan, impl, design - Development branches
- test, stage, prod - Deployment branches
- pages, codex - Documentation branches

All branches follow the spec-bootstrap branching model.

## Support
See SETUP.md for detailed instructions and troubleshooting.
