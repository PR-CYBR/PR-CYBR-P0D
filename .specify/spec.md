# PR-CYBR-P0D Specification

## Overview
PR-CYBR-P0D is an automated podcast episode management system that synchronizes with a Notion database called "pr-cyberpod" to automatically download and publish podcast episodes.

## Problem Statement
Managing podcast episodes manually is error-prone and time-consuming. Content creators need a streamlined way to mark episodes as ready for publication in Notion and have them automatically appear in the repository without manual file transfers.

## Solution
Build an automated synchronization system that:
1. Monitors a Notion database called "pr-cyberpod"
2. Identifies episodes marked as live
3. Downloads MP3 files from provided URLs
4. Commits episodes to the repository under `/episodes/`
5. Maintains full branch structure for proper CI/CD workflows

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### FR1: Notion Database Integration
- Connect to Notion API using secure authentication
- Query the "pr-cyberpod" database
- Parse episode metadata from Notion pages

#### FR2: Episode Status Tracking
- Check "Episode Live" boolean field in Notion
- Only process episodes where "Episode Live" is true
- Track previously synced episodes to avoid duplicates

#### FR3: File Download and Storage
- Download MP3 files from URLs specified in Notion
- Validate file integrity (file size, format)
- Store files in `/episodes/` directory with consistent naming

#### FR4: Automated Commits
- Commit new episodes to git repository
- Include meaningful commit messages with episode metadata
- Push changes to appropriate branches

#### FR5: Branch Management
- Maintain full branch structure from spec-bootstrap:
  - main, dev, spec, plan, impl, design, test, stage, prod, pages, gh-pages, codex
- Ensure episodes are deployed through proper promotion flow

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### NFR1: Performance
- Sync operations should complete within 10 minutes
- Handle up to 50 episodes in a single sync
- Efficient incremental syncing (only new/changed episodes)

#### NFR2: Reliability
- Retry failed downloads up to 3 times
- Graceful handling of network errors
- Continue syncing remaining episodes if one fails

#### NFR3: Security
- Use GitHub Secrets for Notion API tokens
- Validate all file URLs before downloading
- Sanitize file names to prevent path traversal

#### NFR4: Maintainability
- Clear logging of all sync operations
- Modular code structure for easy updates
- Comprehensive error messages

## Data Model

### Notion Database Schema (pr-cyberpod)
Expected fields in each episode entry:

| Field Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------------|------|----------|-------------|
| Title | Title | Yes | Episode title |
| Episode Live | Checkbox | Yes | Publication status flag |
| Release Date | Date | Yes | Episode release date |
| File URL | URL | Yes | Link to MP3 file |
| Episode Number | Number | No | Sequential episode number |
| Description | Text | No | Episode description |
| Duration | Text | No | Episode duration |

### Repository Structure
```
/episodes/
  ├── episode-001-title-slug.mp3
  ├── episode-001-metadata.json
  ├── episode-002-title-slug.mp3
  ├── episode-002-metadata.json
  └── ...
```

## Integration Points

### Notion API
- API Version: 2022-06-28 (or latest stable)
- Authentication: Integration token (read-only)
- Rate Limits: 3 requests per second

### GitHub Actions
- Trigger: Schedule (daily), workflow_dispatch (manual), webhook (future)
- Secrets Required: NOTION_TOKEN, NOTION_DATABASE_ID
- Permissions: Contents write, workflows write

## Future Enhancements
1. Notion webhook support for real-time syncing
2. Episode metadata search/index
3. RSS feed generation from episodes
4. Automated social media announcements
5. Episode analytics and download tracking

## Success Criteria
1. Episodes marked "Live" in Notion appear in repository within 24 hours
2. Zero manual file transfers required
3. All episodes maintain consistent naming and metadata
4. System handles errors gracefully without human intervention
5. Full audit trail of all sync operations
