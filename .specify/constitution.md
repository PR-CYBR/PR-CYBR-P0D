# PR-CYBR-P0D Constitution

## Project Identity
**Name**: PR-CYBR-P0D  
**Purpose**: Official PR-CYBR Podcast Repository - Automated podcast episode management and distribution system  
**Vision**: Seamlessly integrate with Notion database to automatically sync and publish podcast episodes

## Core Principles

### 1. Automation First
- All podcast episode management should be automated where possible
- Manual intervention should only be required for content creation, not distribution
- Notion database serves as the single source of truth for episode metadata

### 2. Transparency and Traceability
- Every episode sync should be traceable through git commits
- Episode metadata should be clearly documented
- All automation should log its actions

### 3. Reliability
- Failed syncs should not break the repository
- Episodes should be versioned and immutable once published
- Rollback capability should be maintained

### 4. Specification-Driven Development
- Follow the Spec-Kit framework for all development
- Maintain clear separation between specification, planning, and implementation
- Document all decisions and changes

## Non-Negotiable Rules

### Security
1. **Never commit secrets**: API keys, tokens, and credentials must use GitHub Secrets
2. **Validate all inputs**: Sanitize file names and URLs from external sources
3. **Secure API access**: Use read-only Notion API tokens when possible

### Code Quality
1. **Follow branching strategy**: Maintain the full branch structure from spec-bootstrap
2. **Document everything**: Code should be self-documenting with clear comments
3. **Error handling**: All external API calls must have proper error handling

### Content Management
1. **Episode immutability**: Once an episode is published, its file should not be modified
2. **Consistent naming**: Episode files must follow a consistent naming convention
3. **Metadata preservation**: Episode metadata must be stored alongside MP3 files

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.x for Notion API integration
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automation
- **Storage**: Git repository for episode files
- **Integration**: Notion API for database synchronization

## Development Workflow
1. All changes must follow the spec → plan → impl → dev → main flow
2. GitHub Actions workflows must be tested before merging to main
3. Branch protection rules must be enforced on main, stage, and prod branches

## Maintenance and Support
- Regular reviews of Notion API integration
- Monitor for failed sync operations
- Keep dependencies updated and secure
